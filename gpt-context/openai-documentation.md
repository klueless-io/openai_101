Batching Prompts:
- **Increased Throughput**: Batching multiple tasks into each request can help utilize available token capacity more efficiently.
- **Implementation**: The `prompt` parameter can accept a list of strings, allowing multiple tasks to be processed in a single API call.

Safety Recommendations:
- **Automated Retries**: Use automatic retries with exponential backoff to recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data.
- **Rate Limit Awareness**: Design your application to be aware of rate limits, potentially adjusting request patterns based on current usage and limits.

The guide underscores the importance of understanding and effectively managing rate limits to ensure a smooth operation of applications that utilize the OpenAI API, promoting efficient use and preventing potential disruptions.
